    <h2>What is a nerd?</h2>

    <p>
      Nerdistic Behaviour Disorder (often misdiagnosed as autism) is a complex
      developmental disability that affects how a person makes sense of the
      world around them. Nerds are typically associated with OSSA (open source
      software addiction) and male betaness. Are you a nerd?

    <h2>What is autism?</h2>

    <p>
      Experts agree that autism, for the most part, is a made up disorder by the
      extreme left. Studies show that in reality, only 5% of those diagnosed
      with autism actually have the disorder. The other 95% are lied to by their
      parents and the MSM complex; "autism" is usually a mere symptom of a
      legitimate curable mental disorder known as Nerdistic Behaviour Disorder.
