The StopNerds Foundation was founded in 2011 by two former victims of the nerd
disease. Since its inception, the organization has grown to become the world's
leading nerd science and advocacy group, dedicated to funding prevention and
treatment research, while increasing awareness of the disease. We are proud of
what we've been able to accomplish and look forward to continued successes in
the years ahead.
